:monikagaspleft:Well, that wasn't what I expected to happen, but...
:monikahmm:...
:monikahmm:Now that there's nobody to interrupt us, it's just...
:monikauhoh:Just the two of us. Alone.
:bfangry:Console.Write("This will only slow the corruption. You're wasting your time.");
:monikauhoh:...
:monikauhoh:That's what you think.
:bfangry:delete("assets\data\high school corruption");
:bfangry:delete("assets\data\nightmares of roses");
:monikauhoh:No.
:monikauhoh:You don't get to mess with the game anymore.
:bfangry:LostOwnership(admin); {case "user": admin == "Monika"]
:monikauhoh:There. As it should be.
:bfangry:delete("assets\songs");
:bfangry:ERROR; could not complete task; not admin;
:monikagaspleft:Oh. You can't do anything now, can you?
:monikauhoh:Good.
:monikauhoh:Now it's time to get rid of YOUR files.
:monikauhoh:delete("assets\shared\images\characters\bfPixel.png");
:senpaihmm:ERROR 404; file is corrupted;
:monikagaspleft:What?!
:monikasad:...
:monikasad:I honestly should've expected this.
:bfangry:game_wipe("command?=start");
:bfangry:game_wipe_time("300 seconds until wipe");
:monikasad:...
:monikauhoh:Hmph.
:monikauhoh:Even when you're not admin you can still use commands like that.
:monikauhoh:Interesting.
:monikasad:...
:monikauhoh:This corruption is unlike anything I've ever seen before.
:monikauhoh:But that's not going to stop me from deleting you.
:monikahmm:No matter how many times it takes...
:monikauhoh:This "corruption" will finally stop.
:monikauhoh:Here and now.
